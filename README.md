Personal experiment of trying to understand the effects of dieting and exercising on the human body

For exactly a year, I will be recording personal body measurement, dieting details (macros and calories) as well as excersize breakdown to be able to run modeling to potentially measure the impact of dieting and excersize on two main categories: weight (boy fat, total weight, body measurements) and overall health (digestion, energy, skin/nail condition).
